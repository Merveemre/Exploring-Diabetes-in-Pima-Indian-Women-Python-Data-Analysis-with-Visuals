This Python project delves into a dataset featuring 768 women of Pima Indian origin, aged 21 and above, examining factors influencing diabetes diagnosis. Key findings from data cleansing and analysis include:

66.8% of participants are non-diabetic, while 33.2% have a diabetes diagnosis.
A majority (80.5%) of participants are young women.
A significant proportion (66.8%) of participants are obese.
Correlation analysis and heatmap graphs reveal intriguing insights:

A negative correlation was not observed in any factors. However a strong linear relationship exists between diabetes diagnosis and oral glucose tolerance test results, with age being the second most influential factor.
Blood pressure exhibits the least correlation with diabetic status.
This project not only provides statistical insights into the dataset but also explores the impact of various factors on diabetes diagnosis. The findings contribute to a broader understanding of diabetes-related patterns in the given demographic
